# Path_Finder
Project Description

This project demonstrates the behavior of uninformed search algorithms in a dynamic grid environment using Python and Pygame. The primary goal is to visualize how algorithms “think” step by step, highlighting:

Nodes being explored (explored set)

Nodes waiting to be explored (frontier)

The final path found

Dynamic obstacles can appear randomly during the search, forcing the algorithm to adapt and re-plan its path.

Key Features:

Visual GUI for real-time step-by-step search

Dynamic obstacles (runtime events) with random probability

Highlighted frontier, explored nodes, and final path

Six algorithms implemented:

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)

Depth-Limited Search (DLS)

Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)

Bidirectional Search

Start and Goal points visually marked

Configurable grid size, cell size, and search speed

Clear GUI title: “GOOD PERFORMANCE TIME APP”
